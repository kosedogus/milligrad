# milligrad

It is c00l to build something from scratch. But it can be even more enjoyable to try to build something on an engine with solid foundations.
I first started to think build from scratch but because Micrograd more or less has the same foundations that I wanted to create, I wanted to get my starting point from there.

In the coming days, I plan to enlarge Micrograd by adding new optimizers, activation functions and implementation of different network models.
The things I add will be specified in the following items:
- Update README file :)) (c00l start isn't it?)
